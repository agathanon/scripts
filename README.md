# scripts
just a repository of scripts that probably won't be worked on regularly, lol. figured i'd at least get a repo going.

- bgp-tools.sh - Keeps a local cache of data from [bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools). Best when as a cronjob.
- certs - Grab certificates from [crt.sh](https://crt.sh)
- cjq - Colorized `jq` output in `less`
